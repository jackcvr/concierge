# Concierge

Concierge is an unconventional TCP Reverse Proxy designed to hide any TCP services "behind" HTTP server.

It works by starting an HTTP server that dynamically creates TCP listeners 
upon requests to a predefined URLs. It responds with the new port number, which the client must connect to.
Traffic from the first successful connection is then redirected to another(usually internal) 
service on a designated port. The opened port exists only for that one connection.

Other features:
- Only the original requesterâ€™s IP is allowed to connect to the provided port.
- Requests to undefined URLs are tarpitted unless `-ntp` argument is provided.
- You can bind any number of URLs to endpoints by repeating `-a` argument.

## Installation

See [Releases](https://github.com/jackcvr/concierge/releases)

## Usage

```shell
Usage of concierge:
  -a value
    	Endpoint in format 'url:host:port' (e.g. /ssh:localhost:22)
  -b string
    	Local address to listen on (default "0.0.0.0:80")
  -crt string
    	Crt file for TLS
  -f string
    	Log file (default stdout)
  -key string
    	Key file for TLS
  -ntp
    	Do not tarpit wrong requests
  -q	Do not print anything
  -t duration
    	Timeout for accepting connections (default 2s)
  -v	Verbose mode
```

## Example

On remote machine:
- configure SSH server to bind to localhost.
- start the Concierge TCP server over HTTPS, which responds to requests made to the `/ssh` path:

```shell
$ sudo concierge -a /ssh:localhost:22 -crt server.crt -key server.key

```

On local machine:
- connect to your SSH server (assuming the IP of your remote machine is 8.8.8.8):

```shell
$ ssh root@8.8.8.8 -p $(curl -sk https://8.8.8.8/ssh)
```
